This section discusses miscellaneous licensing information, such as upgrading, license expiry and grace periods.
Upgrading to Citrix XenServer 6.2.0 from a Previous Free Edition of Citrix XenServer
After upgrading a XenServer 6.2.0 host or pool from a previous free edition, you will have an unlicensed, but fully
functional edition of XenServer. However, in XenCenter the status will display as Unsupported and you will be
unable to apply hotfixes or other updates using XenCenter.


6.1.0
After you install a XenServer host, it runs as XenServer (Free) for 30 days. After this period, you cannot start
any new, suspended, or powered-off VMs until you activate it (to continue using the free XenServer product) or
configure Citrix Licensing for it (to use XenServer Advanced editions and higher).
